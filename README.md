# Problem
Classify 3 Shapes in the Dataset
# Dataset Description
Dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 784-dimensional vector, which when reformatted as an image has the appearance of one of 3 shapes - triangle, square or pizza.

Four flat binary data files are available on this site:

        Shapes_1_1_Train_Features.dat: training set features (47040000 bytes) 
        Shapes_1_1_Train_Labels.dat: training set labels (60000 bytes) 
        Shapes_1_1_Test_Features.dat: training set features (7840000 bytes) 
        Shapes_1_1_Test_Labels.dat: training set labels (10000 bytes)

Once you import a feature file by reading in all the bytes, you must partition the data into lists of 784 elements. Each of these lists can be viewed as an image of a handwritten shape by reformatting it as a 28x28 matrix.
